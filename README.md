# Summix
Hidden Ancestry Summix Work

Modified Summix Function removes sum to 1 constraint and changes it to sum <= 1 (done within the SLSQP function). It has been updated along with the new Summix loss. The second half of the code is a simulation framework to quickly test the function if desired.

The ancestry node link diagram is a Shiny app.
